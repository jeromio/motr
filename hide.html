Fill out this form for booking consideration. The Showroom has a capacity of 450, but can be configured for more intimate setting for smaller events Sunday-Wed. Please let us know which type of show you’re interested in – in the subject line. We only book through this form. Please supply links to music <strong>and</strong> Social media sites. As much as we care about how good the music is, the ability to promote and bring people is <strong>just</strong> as important. Please do not call or drop off press kits at the venue. Once a show is booked, we will need at least 6 posters to hang at Motorco.<br>
<br><strong>Radius:</strong> Do not Play 15 days before OR after within 30 miles from the venue.
